# List the method to calculate total distributed generation in each region (not all
# regions need to be listed here). Both methods use a normalized profile in the file
# specified by "distributed_gen_profiles_fn". Values for each planning year/region
# should be included in the "distributed_gen_values" parameter.
# - "capacity": Use the capacity (MW) to scale up generation
# - "fraction_load": Distributed generation is a specific fraction of total load
# distributed_gen_method:
#   NY_Z_A: capacity
#   NY_Z_B: capacity

# in "distributed_gen_method". These can be varied by scenario by adding them to an
# associated scenario in "settings_management".

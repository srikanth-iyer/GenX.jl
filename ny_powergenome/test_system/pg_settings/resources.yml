# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions

# Because Var_OM_Cost_per_MWh_In is not part of the ATB database the value should be set

# The keys in cost_multiplier_technology_map are technologies listed in EIA's capital
# cost assumptions document. The 2020 version is available at
# https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo20/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf
# Values in the list are string-matched to technologies (`<tech>_<tech_detail>`) from ATB.
# Be sure to include any custom technologies you are using from `additional_technologies_fn`
# or `modified_atb_new_gen`.
# If a value in one of the lists matches more than one technology, the cost multiplier
# will only be applied to the first technology.
# If you want to modify the regional cost corrections CSV, you can put your own copy in
# the folder PowerGenome/data/cost_multipliers.

# The status codes below exclude plants where regulatory approvals have not been
# initiated or received. "Other" is also excluded.
proposed_status_included:
  - V # Under construction, more than 50 percent complete
  - TS # Construction complete, but not yet in commercial operation
  - U # Under construction, less than or equal to 50 percent complete
  - T # Regulatory approvals received. Not under construction

# Heat rates are from EIA's AEO 2019 Cost and Performace report (Table 8.2)
# or NREL's 2018 ATB. ATB technologies use 2020 heat rate values.
# All AEO heat rates are for advanced technologies and use values from the final
# heat rate column
